# Double-Dabble-Algorithm
This is a VHDL code for converting a binary number to a BCD (binary-coded decimal) number using the Double Dabble Algorithm.

This algorithm is a way to convert binary numbers into BCD for display purposes. 
I created this code to display numbers on a seven-segment display on a Nexys4 DDR FPGA Board.
This code is effcient, has comments explaining how the conversion works, and most importantly is portable. Therefore, it can be used in a wide range of projects.
