# Double Dabble-Algorithm
This is a VHDL program for converting a binary number to a BCD (binary-coded decimal) number using the Double Dabble Algorithm.

## Features & Design Purpose
- Converts binary number of any desired length into the corresponding amount of BCD digits 
- Works well with Seven Segment Displays
- Created in Xilinx Vivado for a Nexys4 DDR FPGA
- Efficient, portable, and well-documented VHDL code
